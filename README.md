Project Requirements:
Word count:
According to INK = 3305
Story:
The story I chose is a twist on the copyright free version of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
Decision Points:
First decision point: line 64-66
This is the first critical point that will impact the ending, you must choose between three varying options that change the creature you have created. Specifically you decide whether this creature was built with a focus on functionality, aesthetics, or ethics.
Second decision point: line 97&100
You are asked whether you would like to name the creature “Adam” which is a nod to the original story which mentioned it yet never named it. Or to keep it as the creature to ensure it has no real identity. Just reiterating it is just a project.
Third decision point: line 203 & 206
Here you have to decide whether to reason or command your creation
Fourth decision point: line 219-220
You must choose to create your creature a wife or not.
Fifth decision point: line 235-236
You choose whether to destroy your creation or not.
